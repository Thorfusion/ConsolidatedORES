# ConsolidatedORES
Currently only adds missing deepslate ores that efr in our modpack and adds alot of poor ores as our modpack has veiny ores and we wanted to not be too op

A library of universal ores, ingots and alike that forked 1.7.10 uses

The idea of this mod is to add the basic stuff like, copper ore, dust and ingot but no recipe's. These blocks/items will then be used by forked mods and unify 1.7.10 ores finally

We do add support for EFR
This mod also adds poor ores for veiny ores
